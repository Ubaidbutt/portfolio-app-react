## Portfolio APP
This is a small portfolio application that I built following a course series. This is a SPA (Single Page Application) that shows a bit of introduction, projects and social profile links. This project was helpful in understanding React, JSX, Components and fundamentals of how React is different than other front-end frameworks and libraries. 

### How to run this code
- Download the code and install dependencies by running "npm install"
- Run " npm run dev" to start the server at localhost:1234
